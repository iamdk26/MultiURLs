# MultiURLS


This is a basic Bash script that helps automate repetitive tasks.

The script collects URLs from four different tools: Get-All-Urls, Waybackurls, Gau-Plus, Katana, Waymore, and Hakrawler.

It gathers all the URLs, puts them together in one file, and makes sure there are no duplicates.

This script is super useful for bug hunters because it saves them from doing boring, repetitive work!
